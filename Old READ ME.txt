######################### Bike Share Project #########################

This is the Bike Share project done by Mansour Arab for the "Programming for Data Science Nano Degree".

The code is made by Python 3.9 and used Anaconda environment.

Please feel free to navigate the module and I would be happy to have your inquiries sent to my email: mansour.t.arab@gmail.com

#How the program works:
- You need to enter one of the three cities mentioned that we have info about.
- You need to choose whether to have a day and\or a month filter.

*The module then will calculate all the necessary statistics for you.

- Then you will be asked if you want a sample of raw data.
- Then it will asks you if you want to do another analysis or quit the module.

I hope you enjoy using it!
